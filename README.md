# Predict the missing parts of code using Deep neural networks

The goal of this project is to design, implement, and evaluate a neural network-based code completion
approach. Given a partial program, the approach  should suggest source code to be inserted at a specified location. The model is implemented based on LSTM and RNN approach.
